      <h2 id="headline">Facts about Alan Turing:<h2>
       <ul>     <li>He is the Father of Modern Computer Science</li>
        <li>He played a key role in winning the World War II</li>
        <li>He tried out for the Olympics</li>
        <li>He was prosecuted for being gay</li>
        <li>The British Governmnet only recently apologized for Alan's conviction</li>
        <li>Alan Turing's full genius wasn't recognized in his lifetime</li>
        <li>The Turing Test is still used to measure artificial intelligence</li>
        <li>He created the first computer chess program</li>

        <h2 id="headline">Why I chose him for the Tribute Page:<h2>

          <p>First of all, in 1939, Turing worked for the British Intelligence team at Bletchley Park. He immediately got to work on cracking the Enigma code. Together with his colleague Gordon Welchman, they designed a codebreaking machine called bombe. They were able to shorten the decoding steps. This machine was able to decode more than 4000 messages a day. The army had 200 bombe machines created to help with the war. Turing had a great contribution to World War II. His ability to crack the Enigma code shortened the war by two years. This way millions of lives were saved.</p>

          <p>BUT, being gay in Britain back in the 1950s was considered illegal. An investigation on Turing’s sexuality was carried out and he admitted to having sexual relations with a guy. He was charged with gross indecency and got convicted. The state gave him an option between jail term and probation. There was also a condition that got treatment to reduce his libido. Turing chose to get sterilized, a procedure that took a year. He became impotent; the side effects of this were his breasts became enlarged.</p>
          <p>In the present, Homophobia is no longer condoned in Britain, for this reason, there was an online petition to pardon Alan Turing. This happened 61 years after he was charged for gross indecency. In 2009, the then Prime minister Gordon Brown expressed regrets for how the great man was treated. He was fully pardoned in 2013 when he received an exceptional royal pardon from the Queen of England.
</p>

<p>Overall, despite being a recognized mathematician in his day, Alan Turing’s contributions to the world were not fully appreciated by his contemporaries. Since Turing’s work deciphering the Enigma machine was classified for many years after his passing, his contributions to the war effort and to mathematics were only partially known to the general public when he was alive.</p>

<p>And on June 7, 1954, Alan Turing, a British mathematician who has since been acknowledged as one the most innovative and powerful thinkers of the 20th century — sometimes called the progenitor of modern computing — died as a criminal, having been convicted under Victorian laws as a homosexual.</p>
